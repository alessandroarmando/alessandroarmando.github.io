/*
The flags argument determines whether updates to the mapping are visible
to other processes mapping the same region, and whether updates are 
carried through to the underlying file. 
This behavior is determined by including exactly one of the
following values in flags:

MAP_SHARED
	  Share this mapping.  Updates to the mapping are visible to other processes
	  that map this file, and are carried through to the underlying  file.   (To
	  precisely  control when updates are carried through to the underlying file
	  requires the use of msync(2).)

MAP_PRIVATE
	  Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Updates to the  mapping  are  not
	  visible  to  other  processes  mapping  the same file, and are not carried
	  through to the underlying file.  It is unspecified whether changes made to
	  the file after the mmap() call are visible in the mapped region.
